Thoughts and code by David Moser for the dna-music project. So far it is all in python2.7.x, though this will change as I port it to other purposes, forking as I go. I will most certainly re-port as a Android app once I am confident in the robustness of the music generation algorithm.

Thus far the project consists of three parts:
    1. A dna-to-music parser which converts a simple gene-bank textfile of a genome to codon sequences that will encode proteins, then converts these codon sequences into useful chunks for writing to a midi file.
    2. A "baroque" writer that converts the raw dna music data chunks into a three-part-harmony-with-continuo midi file.
    3. A front end gui for user interaction, including (in later versions) choosing music types, instrumentation, playback, and file permanence, including the option to print out musical notation.


(1) is mostly complete, and I will load as I collect it from its sources... I am new to git and this will take a few days. (2) is in active development as you read this. I am using fractal processes to expand the dna-code and "re-factor" it into python. Sounds kind of arrogant, even to me, as I write it. (3) is still in the form of some sketches and scribbled pseudo-code.

Any help or suggestions are appreciated... blinddonkeyhotai@gmail.com
